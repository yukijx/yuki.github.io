        ðŸŒ¸ Hello! ðŸ‘‹
        <br><br>
        <b>This website is still under construction...Thank you for your patience!</b>
        <br><br>
        My name is <b>Yuki Zheng</b> and I currently study <b>computer science</b> at the <b>University of Oklahoma</b>. 
        <br><br>
        I'm a first generation student extremely passionate about furthering quality STEM education and mentorship to 
        under-represented groups (such as rural, low-income, first-generation, etc). 
        <br>
        If you're interested in my 15-year action plan on working towards this goal, stay tuned! â‚ŠËšâŠ¹â™¡
        <br><br>
        My career interest is to start off in a technical position and eventually transition to management. 
        Interdisciplinary teamwork, leadership, time management, and mentorship are my strongest suits and have been 
        exemplified over the past three years of my undergraduate experience. 
        <br><br>
        If you're more interested in a brief overview of what I do, here is my <a href="documents/Yuki_Resume.pdf"><b>resume</b></a>! ðŸŒ¸
